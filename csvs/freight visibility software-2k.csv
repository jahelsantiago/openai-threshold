A continuous geomechanical property log is generated for any unconventional reservoir including confined and unconfined compressive strengths, Young’s modulus, porosity, permeability and Poisson’s ratio at each drilled depth along the horizontal wellbore. Using this geomechanical logging data, clients can now selectively stimulate horizontal reservoirs and complete the best reservoir rock. The industry standard practice of geometrically spacing fractures may actually miss the best reservoir pay and merely perforate good, mediocre or poor reservoir rock.

Unlike other devices, it is based on breathing and enables athletes to always know precisely their limits where they improve the most when training, while reducing the risk of fatigue injuries. We believe many sportsmen, amateurs or professionals, are far from reaching their maximum potential. Then there is breathing, this fundamental biological process, the only one that brings oxygen, an essential fuel, in the blood. The problem is that this vital parameter is underused. Why? Simply because, today, there is no convenient way of monitoring the volume you are breathing. And that's where we come in. There are new technologies that we, as recent graduates, understand extremely well, without the industry bias that would lock us using already proven techniques. Navigating between cutting-edge sensor technologies and huge amount of data, we enable individuals to push their limits further they could have imagined, to be a better version of themselves. We would have reached our goal by seeing a professional getting his first medal or, maybe even more symbolic, by helping an amateur running his first marathon. They're life-changing challenges, and getting the right advice is key."

Our goal is to support the generation of wind energy by developing innovative sensor solutions and enabling permanent and accurate monitoring of rotor blade condition and operation to achieve the best performance for our customers. Our motivated team is committed to ensuring the best possible performance and capability of wind turbines worldwide. 🚀 The patented and DNV certified on blade solution is mounted directly on the blade surface. With its innovative technology, the sensor system is able to reliably detect icing, measure surface temperature for preventive heating. Furthermore, it detects even the smallest rotor blade misalignment under all turbine operating conditions. The on tower system continuously measures and analyzes changes in the sound generated by blade damage. It is attached magnetically to the base of the tower of the wind turbine at a height of approximately four meters. Through an add-on, it can detect not only blade damage but also lightning strikes through magnetic field measurements and provide data for setting appropriate measures. The acoustic in blade system is installed at the blade access panel or within the blade depending on the preference. There it uses sound emission to detect root zone structural damage. All sensor solutions are suitable for new installations as well as for simple retrofitting on existing wind turbines."

4306833,"0.2728490396051704","Primordial Labs' mission is to enable warfighters to easily and naturally harness the power of complex systems. We think human interaction should be design principle #1 for autonomous system development. Serving DOD customers well means never forgetting that humans are more important than hardware. That’s the only viable path to a fast, connected, and fully-enabled future force. That's why we have built Anura, the tactical AI assistant. Anura empowers human performance across domains and missions by offering an expressive, high-torque interface for interacting with robotic and computer systems. Target number one is drastically reducing the mental workload required to command & control teams of unmanned systems. We aim to turn individual operators into tactical battle managers rather than UxS pilots. Our conversational voice command interface and platform independent autonomy engine are helping us achieve that goal by empowering warfighters to intuitively direct robots through verbal mission-type orders. We’re also expanding Anura to support intelligence analysis and mission planning, orchestrating and accelerating all the low-level tasks required to go from raw data to powerful insights based on a user’s intent. Our first production release is scheduled to be complete in Mid-2023; Anura will be available on multiple fielded DOD UAS platforms. We’re teaching machines to speak warfighter. A skill we think will only become more important as the DOD takes on a one-to-many human to robot ratio in the coming years. The time has come for a natural, high-torque interface that enables human-machine collaborative excellence. We would love to hear from potential users and partners; reach out to schedule a demo or discussion and let us know what you think."

At SwitchLane, we focus on: - INTEGRITY: While we want to grow our company and be successful, we always strive to do ""the right thing"" by our employees and our clients. We have seen too many examples of vendors that focus on making a quick buck. This can lead to short-sighted decisions and in the worst cases can include things that cross over ethical lines. We simply won't do that - FLEXIBILITY: One hallmark of our success thus far has been our ability to be flexible and deliver services in the way that makes the most sense for our clients. While we have “standard” ways of doing things, we can adapt to different approaches and styles as needed. This flexibility has allowed us to help a variety of clients ranging from public sector agencies to both public and private companies. Doing business with a vendor shouldn't be a burden. - DIVERSITY: More things in this world should be based on merit. The person who produces the best results should be rewarded the most. It shouldn't matter whether that person is a man or woman, what country they come from or what color their skin may be.

About Pierre Subehm, founder and CEO of X Network: Pierre Subeh is an author, business expert, and award-winning executive producer. He is mostly known for advocating Middle-Eastern representation and pushing the U.S. Department of State & The White House under the Biden-Harris administration to recognize April as the national Arab American Heritage Month. He has been featured for his business expertise on Forbes, The Washington Post, Yahoo News, CNBC, and The New York Post. Early on in his career, he focused on studying the psychology of human behavior and the science behind efficient productivity. He is a natural leader when it comes to managing teams and creating successful ventures. Pierre was awarded as a young entrepreneur when he owned a 6-figure profitable business at age 17. Subeh was born on 25 October 1998 in Lattakia, Syria. He moved with his family to the Caribbean island of Curaçao in 2010 and settled between the Caribbean and Florida. Following graduation from the Florida Virtual School in the Curaçao American Preparatory School Institute, he attended Harvard Business School under a fully paid scholarship opportunity to their CORe program. Subeh is a columnist on business and marketing for Forbes and several other major publications. He makes frequent TV appearances across North America and the Middle East for his business expertise. In 2021, he was invited as a judge of honor to the American Business Awards where he judged over 221 submissions and helped determine the winners of ''Best in Business''. Pierre Subeh makes a significant part of the modern history of Arab Americans with his accomplishments. His campaign convinced the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and The White House under the Biden-Harris administration to recognize the month of April as the National Arab American Heritage Month. In 2021, he openly criticized The Academy Awards for not having enough Arab-American representation, which picked up the media attention of the largest magazines and publications in the world to interview him. His infamous quote, ''We're only mentioned when Aladdin is brought up. I don't feel motivated to gather up my family on a Sunday to sit through a four-hour award ceremony that never has any sort of mention about our culture and religion. Yet as Muslims, we make up roughly 25% of the world population'', which would later be featured in the Associated Press, Washington Post, The New York Post, ABC, CNBC, and Yahoo Movies."

These items can shed hundreds of thousands of plastic micro plastics into our waterways, atmosphere and soil with each load of wash. Plastic microfibers add to the 380 million tons of plastic waste generated each year. Today, there are now 500 times more pieces of plastic in our ocean than stars in the sky.

We are passionate about renewable energy and believe that providing low carbon EV charging infrastructure is the key to decarbonising the transport sector. Where better to do that than in a car park? 3ti has a unique three technology (“3t”) approach to generating renewable energy, by integrating solar PV with battery energy storage systems and EV charge points in car parks. Solar energy from a car park is a low cost, low carbon, innovative way of powering businesses, including factories, offices, shopping centres and leisure venues. Combining it with a battery and local mains power allows 3ti to provide much needed EV charge points for customers, employees and guests. EV charging in a solar car park With around half of UK households unable to charge an EV at home, destination and workplace solar car parks are a cost-effective, sustainable way of providing not only low carbon electricity but also charging infrastructure to support the switch to EVs. Installing a solar car park to generate renewable energy and provide EV charge points facilitates destination and workplace charging in large numbers. This allows EV drivers to charge their vehicles whilst at work, out shopping, visiting a theme park or even at the gym! Solar car park funding 3ti funds the installation and operation of its solar car parks, through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), meaning that customers don’t have to commit to any significant capital expenditure. The PPA fixes the cost of electricity for the customer, with simple monthly payments for the power generated, delivering immediate savings, visibility of future energy costs and securing long term energy supply. Why a solar car park? • Reduce electricity costs • Secure energy supplies • Meet sustainability targets • Cost certainty and transparency"

In January 1920, McCoy was the first to fill his schooner with alcohol in the Caribbean & sail it up to New York. Anchoring three miles offshore in what was then international waters, McCoy was able to legally act as a floating liquor store to the speakeasies of Manhattan. Others copied McCoy, but they watered down or sullied the alcohol by adding chemicals like turpentine or wood alcohol in what became dubbed “Booze” or “Hooch.” McCoy provided only top quality, unadulterated spirit - inspiring his product to be known as “The Real McCoy.” Today, our rums are handcrafted in the Prohibition Tradition® - with the same authenticity as the celebrated rum that fueled the Roaring ‘20s - - barrel aged, no added sugars, flavors or aromatics. Our rum rivals the top sipping spirits in the world. This is the genuine article… It's The Real McCoy®"

In 1998, Hennepin County Corrections collaborated with Osiris to create a computer-training center in the Hennepin County Home School, An adolescent treatment facility in suburban Minneapolis. Osiris’ life skill mentoring and technology programming was included as a course curriculum for the youth residents. From the success of the computer course at the HCHS, students requested Osiris expand programming into Minneapolis communities offering an after-care program. The youth residents at the HCHS suggested Osiris contact the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board Public Parks to construct computer centers to utilize, hone, and advance their computer training. Most youth would return to their homes in urban Minneapolis and felt that working within easy commuting distance of their homes would enhance their adjustment post treatment. In 1998, Osiris’ Executive Director, Bill Roddy, took the idea of the youth he was mentoring and approached Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board’s Powderhorn Park Director, Corky Wiseman. Corky agreed to establish a collaborative relationship to build a computer center to serve the entire surrounding community members as well as employ Osiris technology program youth as entry-level tech assistants. Other opportunities to serve urban Minneapolis communities would soon follow, allowing Osiris to build computer centers throughout the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board system."

Using drawing, painting and collage to make these invisible experiences visible enables the indescribable to be shared with others and thereby increases the understanding of another’s subjective experience. Body mapping is an arts-based research tool, which, due to its focus on embodied experience, lends itself to the exploration of bodily and psychological feelings and experience. Body mapping involves tracing around a person’s body to create a life-sized outline, which is then filled in via a creative and reflective process, producing an image that reveals aspects of embodied experience. Within Hatsumi's virtual reality experience, you will be guided to create your own, life-sized body map, which visualises and explores lived experience. You will be led through a series of meditative and creative activities based on the tenets of mindfulness during the body mapping process in order to help articulate and visually express experiences of, and methods for coping with every day and out of the ordinary experiences of pain, emotion and sensory experience. This virtual reality experience is expanding the potential of bodymapping in a new paradigm that can be utilised in communication, research and health interventions for pain, sensory and mental health conditions"

Naira Ávila honed her experience in 2013, as a founding partner of a network of beauty and eyebrow stores in malls, with more than 80 stores opened in Brazil. Danilo Tuffi, on the other hand, comes from the language and IT franchise network segment - Microcamp (a company owned by his family), and was one of those responsible for the expansion of more than 200 schools throughout Brazil. From this union of expertise, Estúdio Mais was born, already with 16 stores, located in the main malls in São Paulo: Pátio Paulista, Morumbi Shopping, Market Place, Shopping Vila Olímpia and Pátio Higienópolis. A solid company, which was born with the credibility and recognition of its customers. A modern environment, with a very well-trained team and modern facilities that have top-of-the-line aesthetic machinery and high-quality products, all to ensure the satisfaction of its customers. The expansion During the four years in which the service focused on eyebrow aesthetics, the team realized that there was a gap in providing good service and generating results beyond this service. Along with this, loyal clients trusted the professionals so much that they clamored for more procedures. Faced with this scenario, the company invested heavily in aesthetics and began offering the most modern facial and body treatments, such as botox, facial filling, intradermotherapy and photodepilation, going beyond simple eyebrow design. With these changes and in order to meet the strict requirements of the legislation and the market, the company added to its team of collaborators a body of dermatologists who were responsible for creating protocols and supervising the procedures performed by biomedical doctors, aiming at excellence in treatments."

By tracking daily observations, identifying emotional triggers, and using shared data insights, you can effectively decode and manage behavior over time. As human beings, we all are complex in how we process and receive information as well as formulate responses or reactions. Some of us could benefit from tracking and analyzing these complexities. Fully customized to allow tracking for every individual, BEHCA displays this data in a series of graphs showing trends and correlations between the variables. BEHCA automatically tracks the natural environment, including daily weather, barometric pressure, humidity, moon phases, and more based on an individual's location. This further expands the potential for understanding the impacts of our environment on our daily living. We have found ourselves looking in every direction, far and wide, in an attempt to understand the most exact function of a behavior.

Many infectious diseases, once the greatest threat to public health and the leading cause of death, have been reduced or even eradicated due to advances in vaccine development, improved sanitation and antibiotics. Despite the significant progress made in the vaccine industry to date, two challenges remain: to produce vaccines against unmet or emerging targets, and to produce improved vaccines that are more effective than currently available products. VLPbio has developed proprietary technologies that address both of these challenges. VLPbio focuses on virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines that mimic viruses but lack the ability to reproduce or cause infectious complications.

The unique location is the UK’s only centre for historic motoring excellence and is the national centre for a £5.5bn per annum industry that employs over 34,000 skilled people. Founded in 2013 Bicester Heritage has gone from a standing start to a home for 45 specialist businesses, and growing, with a collective turnover of over £30m, making it the largest player in the industry and set to grow exponentially with a global reach. The unique ecosystem of businesses based at a beautiful 425-acre former WW2 RAF Bomber Training Station acts as ‘marina-like’ cluster, promoting skills and expertise, employment, qualified customer footfall, shared business incubation and aggregate growth. Collectively, Bicester Heritage is all about driving the future of the past. The former RAF Bicester site on which Bicester Heritage is now based is of national historic importance. Neglected for the best part of 40 years, it was added to Historic England’s ‘At Risk Register’ in 2008 and designated the most 'at risk' of all Defence Estates in the UK. Since Bicester Heritage’s tenure, over 90% of the buildings have been delicately restored or re-activated for modern business use, with the site now held as a national exemplar of constructive conservation by Historic England. The time-warp base is truly unmatched in evocative character, with even the paint colours being correct to 1930s British Standards. An active airfield and test track complete its dynamic operation. The location of Bicester Heritage of course, is key.

Yet, there are limited resources and minimal support offered to those 30 million supporters; most commonly spouses and family members. The rate of recidivism in the U.S. remains steady at nearly 70%. Studies have consistently found that prisoners who maintain close contact with their family members while incarcerated have better post-release outcomes and lower recidivism rates. The programs within our Strong Prison Wives & Families network will help to effectively reduce the rate of recidivism by grooming a strong familial support system; providing advocacy, resources, education, mentoring and fellowship to each member throughout the duration of the prison sentence and well in advance of the inmate's release back into the community. In keeping with recommendations of the Charles Colson Task Force report [2016], we strive to help spouses and family members during the most critical time of the inmate's transition back into society.

Depending on the day we will be open for lunch, dinner, or late night snacking. This is the hottest, freshest, fastest pizza around! When it comes to making great pizza, we feel there is a right way to do it. Here are some insights about Dragon Fire’s philosophy and what we call our pizza ethics. Good pizza ethics dictate that we use the best oven possible. Neapolitan style pizza has been cooked in a wood fired, brick oven for several thousand years! It’s the original, longest lasting, and hottest way to cook a pizza. Our oven is a Mugnaini, hand-crafted in Tuscany, Italy by artisans that know how to handle heat. When the oven is fully up to temperature the air temperature in the oven is well over 1000 degrees. In fact, take a look inside our oven and you’ll see why the other dragons get jealous! There is nothing hotter. Now you know why we call our oven “the Dragon!” We know that growing your own food and picking it fresh off the vine tastes much better than that same item you might buy from a store. That is why we source our produce, meats, cheeses, and toppings locally to ensure we have the highest quality ingredients around. We work with local farms and support our community to help grow area businesses and jobs. Overall, we choose items that fit our philosophy and give true treasures to our guests. Dragon Fire originated in Champaign, IL and is a local, family and veteran owned business. We have combined our knowledge and skills to build a strong foundation for our fledgling little dragon. After much debate and many pizza parties, Dragon Fire has evolved into the delicious options you can now purchase throughout town."

Seus conteúdos são lidos mensalmente por milhares de pessoas interessadas em acelerar a trajetória para o sucesso, por meio da conquista de valiosos insights transmitidos por grandes referências no campo do desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional. O portal foi fundado por Lucas Souza Silva, desenvolvedor web e escritor brasileiro. A ideia de destacar a força do empoderamento feminino surgiu após Lucas Souza Silva ingressar na faculdade de jornalismo, em 2018. Pensando em algo revolucionário, no qual pudesse praticar sua escrita diária e inspirar outras pessoas a conquistarem seus objetivos, ele decidiu unir três pontos que poderiam funcionar muito bem juntos: o futebol, o desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional e o empoderamento feminino. Colocando a ideia em prática, Lucas Souza Silva idealizou o Na cara do gol com Lucas Souza, em que é possível conhecer a história de vida de mulheres persistentes que alcançaram o topo em suas carreiras e na vida pessoal, por intermédio de suas lutas diárias. Raquel Benetti, um dos maiores nomes do futebol freestyle no cenário feminino, já foi destaque no portal mostrando a sua história de superação e um pouco sobre a luta das mulheres contra o machismo. Outras mulheres excepcionais também já passaram pela lista de entrevistadas do Na cara do gol com Lucas Souza — entre elas, estão nomes como Daniela Viek, Dra. Carolina de Paula, Erika Belmonte, Flávia Rita, Jade Yasmin Reis, Jaqueline Gatti, Juliane Fechio, Karina Altieri, Mikarla Freitas, Priscila Stuani, Roberta Santos, Thaís Prado e Viviane Nóbrega. As craques selecionadas vestiram a camisa do empoderamento feminino e compartilharam suas grandes jogadas na vida, a fim de incentivar e inspirar outras mulheres a correrem atrás de seus sonhos e planos. Com um toque de vocabulário futebolístico, Lucas Souza Silva tornou o projeto muito mais interessante, trazendo algo completamente inovador para esse cenário. ''Para mim, ao soar do apito inicial de cada dia, é imprescindível exaltar o brilho em campo de milhares de mulheres que já deram um show de bola em diversas áreas de atuação e conquistaram arquibancadas repletas de aplausos. Dessa forma, além de inspirar outras mulheres, consigo conscientizar a sociedade de que, independentemente da área de atuação, a igualdade do acesso aos direitos e às oportunidades são recursos indispensáveis para revelar novos talentos nos mais diferentes cargos no âmbito profissional. Além disso, consigo desconstruir tabus relacionados ao machismo — evidenciando que o preconceito é apenas um velho hábito de quem não conhece o verdadeiro valor de uma mulher e o potencial de cada uma delas esteja onde estiver''. — Lucas Souza Silva, fundador do Na cara do gol com Lucas Souza.
