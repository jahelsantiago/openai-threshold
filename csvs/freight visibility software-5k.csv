Traditionally, supply chain technology platforms have been siloed and disconnected across discrete operations like warehousing, yard management, and transportation. In contrast, ground level operations are fully integrated. Over time as enterprise systems have enhanced core features and functions, the primary problem of separate and distinct IT systems being used to manage integrated operations has not been addressed. The Renaissant platform is uniquely designed as a logistics workflow engine that enables and accelerates supply chain digital transformation. Integrated workflow bridges the gap between disconnected enterprise technology solutions requiring manual processes, to integrated operations with automated processes that direct optimal outcomes. Proprietary workflows integrate data from enterprise IT systems and combine it with human action to manage all ground level logistics operations. Typical KPIs include reduced driver dwell time and detention charges, improved asset utilization, elimination of demurrage charges, faster inventory turnover, increased shipments, faster yard inspections, reduced exceptions, and improved employee efficiency. Automation of supply chain operations using Renaissant’s proprietary workflows is enhanced and accelerated by additional services we offer, such as schedule optimization, performance analytics, KPI management, predictive analytics, data driven decision making, dynamic tasking, and machine learning."

Each final image is a composite of a virtualized model and a garment photograph, and is indistinguishable from a single, real image. Any of your models can appear to be wearing any of your clothes, but no longer need to attend a photo shoot; in fact, only stylists and garments are required to create new product images, transforming the productivity dynamic of any studio and rewriting your cost-per-image calculations. Multiple Allure Systems studios can be deployed anywhere in the world you choose. Linked to the same Product Information Management system, this liberates you to create unlimited, globally consistent, high-quality, on-brand images, anytime, anywhere. The processing time for any Allure Systems composite image is just a few hours, reducing the time-to-site by, potentially, days. More – and more relevant – images increase a shopper’s confidence to buy. The higher throughput, increased flexibility and reduced human resource requirements of an Allure Systems studio make it affordable for you to showcase every garment with more visuals, and from more angles, than ever before. By using a different virtualised model image with a garment photograph, it’s also easy to create new, perfect product images for different territories or different customer groups, without the need for additional shoots. With augmented reality and 3D destined to deliver initiatives such as improved experience, better image search and personalization, Allure Systems imagery also future-proofs your image assets. While traditional photography can never produce 3D or AR-ready images for you – every Allure Systems studio can deliver 3D/AR-ready content for incorporation into future projects."

1343315,"0.24679732399050613","Intensity Analytics is composed of veteran entrepreneurs who are expert developers, industry thought-leaders and long-time inventors of critical technology. A theme throughout our history has been “identity.” In the many vertical markets we have served, a recurring requirement has been for software which confirms the identity of computer users to a statistical certainty. In recent times, the need to do this has been further evidenced by worldwide cybersecurity breaches. But the need to ascertain identity is substantially broader than just security. It includes the capability to perform Anonymous Identification affordably, quickly, scalably, without special hardware, and without violating growing (GDPR) privacy norms — and to do so in a manner compatible with existing platforms, delivered in both desktop and SaaS versions. There are countless use cases where an application’s facility to recognize a specific individual exactly, without that person having to divulge personal information (e.g., iris characteristics, pictures, fingerprints, SSN, Secret Question) offers dual advantages both to the provider and the consumer. Intensity Analytics has created sophisticated software programs which house patented algorithms that accurately measure human effort when people interact with devices like a smartphone or keyboard. Legacy attempts to meaningfully and reliably classify text patterns, or gestures, to achieve the goal of identifying a person have essentially failed. Our approach is radically different. It has been independently validated by the foremost experts in the field — PhD professors who do this work for the Federal Government — as well as in field-deployed use cases (we could tell you but we'd have to kill you ;). Internally-engineered Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) techniques feed our advanced geospatial, multidimensional mathematics routines to compare previous behavior to current behavior, sufficiently to identify you."

We’ve already done a lot to make finding office space easier but this is just the start and we’re currently working hard to provide you with the tools and information you need to make the best possible office move without having to engage an agent. Why without an agent? Mostly because by removing the agent from the transaction we can operate a far cheaper model and pass these savings on to you, but also because it allows you to talk directly to the people who know best - the providers, and finally because it means we can focus on building tools that make your experience better. Ultimately we believe in a world where workspace is available on tap, where you can switch on and off your space solutions, scale them up or scale them down seamlessly and book it by the hour, the month or the year. While we know that there is a long way to go before we get there, this beta website represents our first few steps towards achieving that vision and as we grow we hope to take lots of little steps towards achieving that reality.

PiFM demonstrates exceptional spatial resolution (~5 nm), excellent sensitivity (monolayer), a good correlation to bulk FTIR spectra, and universal applicability to a wide range of organic and inorganic materials. By imaging infrared wavelengths specific to different chemical entities, PiFM can resolve the nanometer-scale distribution of each chemical species in diverse multi-phase and multi-component systems, thereby revealing an unprecedented and spectacular molecular vista to the researcher.

3692988,"0.26289775184100006","The rapid growth of the Indoor Agriculture industry and its Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) facilities, demand a precise and complicated set of HVAC design requirements. Essentially, all HVAC systems that meet these design requirements would fall under the category of “custom.” As a result, significant risks for operators remain with: scalability; high CapEx; and high OpEx. Harvest Air is a patent pending system that leverages proven technology and is designed specifically for use in CEA facilities. Harvest Air provides value to operators in three key categories: 1. The lowest total cost among qualified systems: Initial CapEx reductions of ~25% and up to 75% reductions in annual OpEx. 2. Improved scalability and increased speed to market: Factory built and tested, with a production capacity of 100 units per month. 3. Unrivalled control of your production environment Zero transfer of outside air to the cultivation environment, and a completely packaged and factory tested control system. At the heart of the patent pending Harvest Air design is the HarvestWheel; a total energy wheel used for indirect air-to-air economization. Indirect air-to-air economization is the use of outside air to cool and dehumidify the cultivation space, without bringing the outside air into the space. The production capabilities behind the Harvest Air units extend to complete supply chain ownership by centralizing the wheel manufacturing, and complete unit controls integration, under one roof. The result is a completely packaged and factory-tested system that ships and installs as a single piece."

5338672,"0.26969864729658477","Entrepreneurs, Executives & Business Owners...you've been told your whole life to allocate your assets a certain way, right? I'm here to tell you, that you've got it backward. It's not about the allocation of the assets... it's about the LOCATION of your assets. Just like buying good real estate...it's all about Location, Location, Location... When your assets are NOT located in the right places, you are being set up to pay higher taxes. And you don't want that right? Of course not. Let me show you how I can help you locate your assets so you pay the least amount in taxes. It starts with our proprietary UniTax Portfolio Solution® Your assets are taxed in different ways, according to the various types of investment accounts held. So it is imperative to have a strategy that addresses asset location. Through our exclusive algorithm, the UniTax Portfolio Solution®, we are able to find after-tax efficiencies and maximize your after-tax return. Our approach is based on the principle of pooling all your investments with a single advisor recommending an integrated and sustainable solution focused on a comprehensive tax-efficient and profit-generating strategy. This software & algorithm isn't available to any advisors in Canada...just us. ...and it was designed specifically for you...the business owners, entrepreneurs, and executives of Canada who are focused on providing the best life for their families and loved ones. It's not about what you make...it's what you keep. In addition to our proprietary algorithm, we provide our clients with customized financial roadmaps. We aim to create air-tight accountability across all the parties involved in your financial planning process to ensure we are hitting the financial milestones over the course of the next 2-3 years. But we can't work together unless we relocate - not allocate - your assets in the right place first using our award-winning managers. If you'd like to access our advice and expertise... leave me a note!"

This is the first step toward a digitized self, as Holmz© is also capable of incorporating physiological data as well. JumpStartCSR management believes that the increasing amount of data being created by numerous monitoring devices should be synthesized to provide superior analysis and diagnosis tools for professionals. The system is targeting two markets initially; sports and healthcare. Research indicates that the majority of injuries in sports are lower body biomechanical issues involving ankles, knees and feet. Approximately 72% of athletes suffer periodically from injury and half of those are due to overuse. Athletic trainers, coaches and athletes across multiple levels of sport (youth to professional) constitute this segment. Within the healthcare community the ability to accurately develop and execute rehabilitation programs is crucial to successful outcomes for their patients in rehab and post-operative recovery.

Just like in an open market economy, suppliers seek the highest possible price, keeping their costs and profit in consideration, and consumers choose the lowest price possible based on their needs and renewable energy preferences. Where the supply and demand bids are matching, a trade occurs delivering a better outcome to both parties compared to the relatively high tariffs and the relatively low buy-back rates.

At merely 11-years-old Ariel has already produced a line of brilliantly colored art-to-wear women’s fashions and men’s accessories ranging from bathing suits and formal wear to show-stopping neckties and scarves. Her artistic designs are a collaboration with her grandfather as she borrows patterns from his electrifying collage art which are then digitally printed onto fabric. To achieve this, she utilizes today’s state-of-the-art 3D printing, LED lighting and laser cutting. The visually explosive results are as exciting as the final burst of a fireworks show. Ariel is naturally imbued with a unique tech and innovation philosophy combined with the timely vision seen in her fashions. She has also been surrounded with art and architecture her entire life. She started sewing at age seven and has always been interested in fashion since she was a little girl.

1528833,"0.28947870982200863","We founded our company knowing that tenants rarely get the upper hand. RentCity is committed to raising the voice of tenants in New York City because there isn’t a place for us to share our rental experiences. Nearly 2/3 of tenants experience renter’s remorse within the first 3 months of living in a new apartment. Whether it’s a neon sign, 5 AM deliveries, awesome doormen or noisy neighbors–anything that affects quality of life–tenants should know what it’s like to live in an apartment before signing a lease. Leases oblige tenants to fork over tens of thousands of dollars in annual rent, and the decision is often made in less than 20 minutes. Nowhere else in life do we make considerable financial decisions with such little information. RentCity’s mission is to end renter’s remorse. On our site (www.RentCity.co) you can choose your next home with our RentCity score and read first-hand reviews from tenants. Happier tenants can lead to longer leases and increased word-of-mouth marketing for landlords. Better information can lead to improved quality of life for the nearly 70% of New Yorkers who rent apartments. Check us out on social media (@RentCity.co) and our RentStories blog (www.RentCity.co/RentStories) and podcast where we host guest speakers and interesting New Yorkers to hear their stories and provide key information to tenants."

But the legal approach is not enough if it does not come along with technical measures to protect privacy and personal data in practice. There is a need on how to address the protection of personal data during the design and development of products, services and systems, which is reflected by the principles of Privacy and Data Protection by Design. Engineers are ultimately responsible for conceiving, designing, constructing and maintaining the systems, services and software and hardware products to comply with GDPR. PDP4E mission is to bring privacy and data protection knowhow into mainstream practice of software and systems engineering, by providing engineers with methods and tools that operationalise data protection principles and regulation, and which are integrated with those others which they customarily use in the different activities that take place throughout the stages of the SDLC (System Development Lifecycle). The project aims to empower engineers to leverage the existent knowhow on data protection and will focus on four principal domains of engineering to provide these methods and tools: risk management, model-driven engineering, requirements engineering and Assurance. Objectives: 1: Introduce features to support privacy by design and data protection into existent mainstream software and system engineering tools. 2: Integrate privacy by design and data protection activities within existent mainstream software. 3: Empower engineers overall to leverage the existent know-how on data protection; even if they are not savvy in the field. 4: Spread the adoption of data protection practice in time and space, by promoting the adaptation of tools and methods to mainstream needs of engineers. 5: Foster the broadest practice of privacy through comunities such as IPEN."

Blushield a revolutionary form of EMF protection that produces coherent frequencies within the human responsive range, based on mathematical algorithms that mimic nature. It emits frequencies using the same power sources as manmade devices, which creates active, powerful fields. It is essentially “loud” enough to compete against the biologically incoherent non-native EMF fields, so it vastly outperforms the protective devices with weak, passive fields that don’t use a power source. Instead of attempting to block EMFs, which is ineffective or suboptimal for various reasons, Blushield essentially overpowers non-native EMFs with resonant frequencies. If there are harmonious frequencies in our environment that match or exceed the power of the inharmonious frequencies, our bodies will prefer and attune to the harmonious frequencies through a process called sympathetic resonance. Tuned into the natural, healing Blushield frequencies, our bodies no longer perceive the non-native EMF’s as a threat, and our immune system begins to restore itself. Our bodies can rest and heal. Blushield emits scalar waveforms that never stimulate your body twice with the same combination of frequencies at the same amplitude - mimicking nature, but much more powerfully. Blushield’s coherent field overrides all ambient EMF fields, including wireless radiation. Blushield’s multiple waveform output is the most sophisticated EMF protection to date, and is engineered to achieve maximum effectiveness for all living creatures."

It offers a new means of transporting people and goods quickly, safely, efficiently and with minimised environmental impact. Hyperloop uses electric propulsion to accelerate a passenger or cargo pod through a low-pressure tube. The autonomous pod levitates slightly using magnets to eliminate friction. It will be faster than an airline and will allow you to travel from London to Edinburgh in 40 minutes. Carbon emissions, noise, delays, weather concerns and pilot error are ultimately eliminated. HYPED is a University of Edinburgh student society dedicated to accelerating development of Hyperloop technology and implementing Hyperloop in the UK. We have over 50 members in the team working on various aspects of the project including technical design of the prototype, manufacturing, economic feasibility, stakeholder engagement and publicity. After a successful year, HYPED has advanced to the final stages of SpaceX’s Hyperloop Pod competition, held in California in Summer 2017. We are one of 24 finalists selected to compete, after showing our technical excellence and ambition both in the previous competition and in SpaceX and university presentations. The competition challenges students to design and build a pod to race along a mile-long Hyperloop tube. HYPED has also been named a winner in the Hyperloop One Global Challenge. Our proposed route linking Edinburgh to London has been selected as a possible location for the very first commercial Hyperloop. In summer 2017, we presented our case at a global conference in Amsterdam, discussing the feasibility of making Hyperloop in the UK a reality. How can I join or sponsor HYPED?

Almost everyone knows the problem: a debtor does not want to pay. If lawsuits make sense and are feasible at all due to the multifaceted jurisdiction, a title will finally be obtained against the debtor concerned after a costly and time-consuming process. However, there is still no money because the debtor moved his assets in good time and/or transferred them to people he knew. Especially if the debtor acted with fraudulent intent, the official measures – which he naturally expected and took appropriate precautions – come into play tired smile.More and more of those affected no longer want to be offered this real debtor protection and therefore resort to alternative debt collection services. Our clients include not only private individuals and small companies, but also multinational corporations and law firms that have reached their limits. Our company offers you a serious solution that is efficient and still legal. We work in an investigative and creative way, paired with an appropriately dosed personal presence at the debtor's site.

We are an advisory and thought leadership initiative helping B2B marketers to better achieve company growth through best practices in account-based marketing (ABM), marketing technology, marketing operations and marketing-sales alignment. With MarTech ROI under increased scrutiny for most marketers, we address these marketing technology challenges by providing blueprints and practical ‘how-tos’ in setting up a comprehensive B2B marketing infrastructure. Establishing a single seamless revenue cycle spanning marketing, sales and customer success lies at the core of success. More effective ABM can be achieved by taking a total system approach to marketing strategy, programs and infrastructure. Accounts are the lifeblood of B2B business. ABM re-focuses and intensifies effort in the right places. Our approach works from the ground up, starting with your CRM (Salesforce or any other), to ensure your marketing systems, data, applications and processes are properly configured and aligned with strategic goals, to enable achieving maximum impact with available resources. Then further enhance and transform your infrastructure and processes into a fully functional ABM platform that works as a connected whole that fully supports both your marketing and sales organizations. While most B2B businesses have a good sense of their target market and ideal customer, few are armed with the right tools, knowhow and processes to clinically target and systematically penetrate those segments. Successfully executing end-to-end ABM means getting a lot of things right: data structuring & enrichment, account configuration, targeting, campaign hierarchies, territory mapping, market sizing, real-time engagement monitoring, pipeline and revenue attribution, predictive analytics, target re-modelling, reporting and dash-boarding. We help you gain command over the entire ABM value chain."

AiDEMONEY is solely African focused, impact driven and deeply invested in the future of communities across the continent. By replacing profit as the point of the spear, we’re providing impact that transcends the transaction. AiDEMONEY was founded by Uzoma Eze, a Houston-based attorney specializing in tax law and anti-money laundering (AML). After spending the last decade helping the African diaspora navigate the American financial system, Uzoma witnessed the shortcomings of these institutions firsthand. Despite a strong need for funding, Africa is the most expensive corridor for money remittances. Meanwhile, money scams from a few bad actors have had widespread repercussions—preventing countless Nigerians from accessing and sending money through official channels. After defending key federal money laundering cases and experiencing the limitations of current remittance services, Uzoma had a powerful realization: If Africans do this for themselves, they can do more. He founded AiDEMONEY in 2020 to realize this vision. Since its founding, AiDEMONEY has built a thriving community on both ends of its money remittance pipeline.

In order to combine the desire for innovation with the zeal for life, the entrepreneur saw, in 2016, in the midst of the greatest economic recession in Brazil, a new possibility to undertake. He took a risk working with diverse audiences, until he found the segment that would most enable him to open horizons and satisfy his purpose of passion for well-being. From an abandoned building, in a context of downturn in the country's economy, the entrepreneur envisioned the public that could continue to be concerned with longevity, good health and that aimed to solve all needs in one place.

Our tech-savvy team members are local hands who grew up in the Williston area and have worked the oil fields, well before the Bakken became what it is today. We know the Bakken! Our team lives here, owns homes here, raising their families here, and we plan on staying here—assisting our clients with their goals—regardless of whether oil prices go up or down. After working for multiple other companies, Evolution founders Alan Roness and John Stach decided it was time to create their own company, a company with a difference. Evolution was born with the mission to bring the “service” back into the oil field services industry. That service includes going the extra mile to find affordable tools and systems that exactly match the clients’ needs, and offer their expertise to further clients’ success. The staff at Evolution Completions genuinely cares about its customers, their needs, their goals, and their bottom line. We will go out of our way to forge productive and accountable relationships and hope to still be servicing the same wells thirty years down the road."

EOS - X is opening near space, guided by three principles that drive our reason to exist: 1. LIVE LIMITLESS EOS - X is driven by the ambition of breaking barriers, of moving beyond the current normal and creating a new reality. Where others stop, we want to go. We remove the “T” from “can't” and live by a “CAN” mentality. Let's break the limits of what tourism is today and take the concept to new heights (+37km, to be specific) 2. MAKE IT WORTHWHILE EOS - X aims to revolutionize near space tourism and open it to a greater audience. Our ambition is to turn space tourism from dream to reality for many and create a true change of paradigm. However, we are determined to not make the same mistakes that humanity has often made, and therefore do not envision a type of space tourism that is not sustainable. EOS - X ́s flights are emission free, and we are committed to offset our carbon footprint of support activities. 3. DISCONNECT TO RECONNECT EOS - X is born with the ambition of making people more human. We are often trapped in daily activities, tasks and worries, and forget about the big picture and what is really important. For the first time, at 37km of altitude, where there is nothing but blackness of space and the blue halo of earth, EOS - X passengers will be able to see this big picture and reconnect with Earth, nature and humankind."

4108001,"0.3057867751629889","Our goal at Mutiny Funds is to help investors maximize the long-term growth of their portfolios. We approach this problem differently than most because of our core belief that: “Offense wins games. Defense wins championships.” In an investing context, this means we believe that combining defensive-minded strategies such as long volatility or trend with offensive-minded strategies such as stocks or fixed income provides the best opportunity for long-term capital growth while reducing drawdowns in the interim. The promise of diversification is to allow investors to improve risk-adjusted returns – either by realizing less risk for a similar return or a higher return for the same risk. We view true diversification as the ability to accomplish the two things most investors care about in their portfolios: Having a lot of assets in the future: That is, maximizing the long-term compounding, or expected terminal wealth of a portfolio. Having enough assets in the interim: That is, making sure that if we need to use our assets for a family emergency, illness, or other unexpected life events (dare I say global pandemic?) in the near term, that it will be there when we need it. We believe building a team of diversified strategies with different return drivers is the best way to facilitate these dual objectives. DISCLAIMER Investing is risky, and you are reminded that futures, commodity trading, forex, volatility, options, derivatives , and other alternative investments are complex and carry a risk of substantial losses. As such, they are not suitable for all investors, and you should not rely on any of the information as a substitute for the exercise of your own skill and judgment in making such a decision on the appropriateness of such investments."

The original stated purpose of the organization was to initiate fund raising events and methods and to direct those funds to appropriate activities of the Guardian ad Litem Program; to promote awareness of the activities of the program and to encourage volunteer resources; and to encourage community activity and awareness. Voices for Children (VFC) started with a need. The State of Florida requires that the interests of every abused and neglected child be represented by a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) in court. While the benefits of this are immeasurable to the child, there aren't enough Guardian Advocates for all of Hillsborough County's abused and neglected children. The GAL program doesn't receive adequate public funding. That's where VOICES helps. Voices for Children is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide the volunteer guardians the financial means necessary for Guardian ad Litem to continue this vital service to children. Currently, the program can serve only about 67% of these children. Our goal is to provide 100% representation for the abused, neglected and abandoned children of Hillsborough County. Through a variety of private funding initiatives, Voices is able to provide the GAL Program with: Increase volunteer recruitment efforts. Identify and develop additional resources and support in order to increase representation of abused and neglected children.

Please donate today! https://lnkd.in/gCG2MeVv We empower university students to take positive action in their communities. Your donation allows ARC7 to pay a small stipend directly into the hands of Compassion Leaders as they implement their community projects. A monthly recurring donation of $7 allows them to buy a 20 pound sack of rice to share. A one-time donation of just $35 pays school tuition for a full semester. $100 a month allows them to initiate projects like this to help child mothers continue their education and have a brighter future. Our Compassion Leader Training requires certified leaders to develop a final project that will eradicate poverty in their Rwandan communities. Implementing these projects transforms the lives of Rwandans university students and puts them on a path of accomplishment, self-reliance, and community service. Every project is as unique as the leader who is planning it, from food production to internet access, to a camp for street kids, to supportive programs for child mothers. Final projects will create part-time jobs, will serve a goal of at least 100 people per month, and will work towards a goal to become self-sustaining after one to two years. ARC7 Compassion Leader Training helps young leaders apply for small project grants, but typically, grant makers do not permit the grant money to be used to pay anyone. That means without your donation that this crucial work would have to be done by unpaid volunteers! Your donation can go a long way to support Compassion Leaders in generating jobs and bettering communities in Rwanda, the 16th most poor nation in the world instead of expecting them to work for free.

PlanetQuest has a decentralized storyline, determined by the players through voting on different dilemmas as representatives of their chosen faction. The game embodies a powerful blockchain gaming economy spanning from players, to planets, to guilds. From rewarding great individual play with quantum rewards, to allowing players to lend out their gear for a quantum fee, to planet and guild owners earning a quantum bonus depending on how well their players do, PlanetQuest puts ownership and earning potential in the hands of its community. Thanks to the power of exchanges, in-game assets can be freely bought and sold, and in-game earnings can be turned into fiat currency. Despite the massive size of our generated assets, our technology runs directly in the browser, even on low-end hardware, allowing us to offer a true zero-friction experience. The game is powered by the Genesis Engine, a unique piece of technology that can procedurally generate entire planets, which can be loaded and rendered in real-time in the web browser. This allows us to sell stunningly beautiful 3d planets as NFTs, which can be orbited and admired on right in the browser and even shown off in augmented reality on mobile devices.

Following 18 years of impact as Community Development Project of the Urban Justice Center, TakeRoot Justice launched as an independent organization in July 2019. Our Approach TakeRoot Justice employs a unique model of partnership with grassroots and community-based groups. Our partners take the lead in determining the priorities and goals for our work, and advance our understanding of justice. This upends the traditional power dynamics between communities and service providers. We believe in a theory of change where short-term and individual successes help build the capacity and power of our partners, who in turn can have longer-term impact on policies, laws and systems that affect their communities. Our work has greater impact because it is done in connection with organizing, building power and leadership development. Our Partners We believe that community organizing should be at the center of any effort to create sustainable, systemic change. TakeRoot Justice has a long history of partnering with grassroots and community-based organizations that build leadership and power within New York City’s low-income communities, particularly communities of color, immigrant communities and others who are traditionally excluded from policy-making.

Over 40% of Americans play video games 3 or more hours a week, because they’re engaging, fun and imaginative. So, while spending numerous hours toiling away at a rowing machine, we thought what if you could just play? That is why we developed SymGym, a fun alternative to traditional exercise. SymGym brings the world of play back to exercise. With SymGym, players can play games, compete with friends, and workout using our resistance based exercise device, video game controller, and gaming platform. In a traditional workout, you exercise.

At the time, Vale do Ave had shortcomings in terms of existence. Entities that intervene in the different dynamics of development, more precisely, in its immaterial components. It is therefore, in this context, that the need arose to create an Entity that could be an Active and Participatory Development Agent in the process of change and modernization of the Territory. In this way, on the initiative of AMAVE and a group of young people looking for their first job, the SOL DO AVE Project began to be worked on, which culminated in the formal constitution of this Entity in July 1993.  Established as an ILE, Sol do Ave received the ILE Women Award from the European Commission, for being an innovative project, of extreme importance for the region and created and managed by women.  Since then, Sol do Ave has been implementing a set of actions in the area of ​​development in the region, namely in its more immaterial components, giving substance to its Mission."

We first try to get the material removed as quickly as possible, then if the damage is done and the perpetrator doesn't cure the issue, then the agreement allows them to resolve the dispute in arbitration, which is a much healthier venue for some of the embarrassing things that could happen online that you don't want public in the conventional court system.

Blocking DSIPs, as demonstrated in-vivo by Onena, simultaneously reactivates physiological TGF-β and BMP signaling and elicits cellular reprogramming, resulting in cancer cells accepting environmental cell death signals from BMPs and Activins. Onena has developed a proprietary AI-centric antibody drug discovery platform that rapidly generates anti-DSIP neutralizing antibodies, even when no crystal structure of the antigen is available. OMED-101, Onena’s anti-LEFTY1/2 lead candidate antibody, has demonstrated broad efficacy against breast, colorectal and brain cancers without observable toxicities in preclinical models.

By bringing its tennis and educational programming directly to where children are living in public housing, KCTL removes the number of barriers to tennis play in Brooklyn, including access to courts, transportation, cost, and coaching, while dismantling the stigma associated with public housing. KCTL’s model operates to address systemic imbalances and one of the root causes of racial gaps in education and health – unequal access to play, quality sports programming and the positive youth development that ensues. Within neighborhoods deeply penetrated by gentrification, KCTL’s model cultivates a more inclusive neighborhood, regardless of socioeconomic status."

Like most Indians, we love sweets, and we are proud of our country’s rich treasure chest of delicacies. But we felt that the ‘maharaja’ of sweets, the laddu, could be made even better with a little innovation. We wished it could be made more suitable for modern lifestyles and needs. Wow Laddus is the result of this desire. It is also the result of several months of experimentation and research. Over 2000 people across India tasted and ‘beta tested’ several different versions of the recipes and gave detailed comments, thus contributing to its current avatar. With all your encouragement and feedback, we are sure we will add dozens of fresh and exciting variants. But Wow Laddus is more than just a better laddu. We think our research for sourcing quality ingredients will help us find ways to improve the story of Indian millets. It will also lead to innovative ways to farm with less and less water, while bringing more high quality nutrition into our lives. In the meanwhile, we hope Wow Laddus will help make all your celebrations special. For those from around the world who have sampled and loved the laddus, please give us a little more time as we fine tune the processes needed to take our laddus to Canada, Australia, the Middle East and the USA."

We encourage veterans and supporters to join our mission and help make Chicago a world class city for veterans and their families. In 2013, a few combat Veterans from DePaul University in Chicago came together to help solve a problem and address their difficult transition to civilian life. Within a few short months, what started as a handful of student veterans from DePaul quickly grew to over 100 veterans from other Universities and campuses in the Chicago-land area. We quickly learned that our struggles to civilian life were universal, from finding quality employment, starting our health/educational benefits and most of all, our sense of camaraderie and unity we had while in the military. We decided to set a goal: to reach out and assist every one of our brothers and sisters we could and let them know there is a community that wants to help. In February of 2014 that simple idea, gave birth to Chicago Veterans and we were awarded our 501(c)3. We are focused on 4 key area's that we identified as critical to the success of our veteran community: Employment Services, Educational Assistance, Networking and fostering Camaraderie between veterans."

In 1987, I met Andre Harrell, president and founder of Uptown Records, Inc.

While at Uptown, I was also responsible for the negotiation and signing of Uptown’s multi-platinum recording artists and producers such as “Mary J. Blige,” “Jodeci,” “Guy,” “Heavy D and the Boyz” and “Al B. Sure” and worked alongside Sean “P-Diddy” Combs. In 1992, I went on to become the VP/General Manager of Untouchables Entertainment, Inc.

I then went on to work with music attorney (and my mentor) Louise West, Esq. of West Entertainment Services, LLC assisting her in the representation of clients such as “Timbaland,” “Missy Elliott” and “Ginuwine.” I now focus my practice on counseling an array of domestic and international clients especially those utilizing a D.I.Y.

Some of the most precious memories in the Koluch family revolve around sitting together and enjoying steamed crabs.    Paul Koluch's entire life revolves around the outdoors. After graduating from Archbishop Curly High School, Paul went to work for Baltimore Gas and Electric, while his passion truly remained on the water. During the 1980's and 1990's Paul was regarded by many as one of the best Bass Fisherman in Maryland, making the B.A.S.S. Federation Maryland State Team over 10 times, and representing Maryland nationally on a few occasions. For Paul, crabbing always held a special place in his heart, and he made the decision to become a full time commercial Waterman.    Paul is a veteran crabber who has supplied some of the most well known crab houses in Baltimore for many years. Paul, his wife of 30 years, along with their children have spent countless hours on the Chesapeake Bay, but his most memorable are the hours he spends teaching his son, Barry the skills of crabbing.   Barry Koluch grew up in a household where fishing and crabbing were just a normal part of life. After graduating from Calvert Hall High School College, he went on to receive a Marketing degree from Salisbury University, always staying close to the Chesapeake Bay. During and after college, Barry was always working weekends on his father's crabbing boat. After spending a few years in corporate sales Barry knew his true passion was crabs!

It is a dramatized expose of the current state of a cultural phenomenon that has grown tremendously over the past two decades. Rolling simultaneously authenticates a specifically twisted consciousness while relating to a broad audience with an eye for detail and human behavior. The film uses a variety of formats (35mm, super 16mm and DV) giving it an unusual texture while maintaining an overall gritty and realistic tone. In doing so, the filmmakers have carefully constructed a new style that hopes to stimulate discussion while regaling the senses. It provides the viewer direct access to the roller coaster of incidents that often occur to an Ecstasy user.

Our modular post-pyrolysis processing systems can apply a wide range of treatments, including a simple water quench, a light acid wash to increase initial cation exchange capacity and decompose any residual poly aromatic hydrocarbons, nutrient impregnation, steam activation, and particle size reduction. As discussed on our rationale page, the structural characteristics and biochemical properties of biochar affect its performance in a given application to a very significant degree.1 2 Hence the term “biochar” describes a family of diverse products rather than a single thing.3 4 To produce biochar for a given need, whether it is to increase soil fertility, maintain livestock health as a feed amendment, remediate contaminated soils or act as a filtration medium, the pyrolysis process must be variable and precise, and the biomass feedstock must be appropriate. Each particle of biomass must receive the exact same heat treatment, and the operator must be able to customize that heat treatment and the post-pyrolysis treatment, so the biochar particles produced have the properties needed for the application. If biochar is used to increase soil fertility, we recommend that it be prepared to emulate humic matter as it is in soil. Wood Vinegar Wood vinegar, also known as pyroligneous acid, is a byproduct of our horizontal bed kiln. Our precise, staged pyrolysis method extracts wood vinegar from the condensates of the gases emitted up to 280° C. Research has shown that this is the ideal temperature range for wood vinegar to be used for agricultural purposes.5 Wood vinegar contains over 200 organic compounds, including acetic acid, methanol and furfural. It is widely used in Asian countries as a plant growth and germination stimulant."

Vision: In 2026, to be a solid and sustainable organization, with its own and replicable model for the protection and promotion of the rights of children and young people in social exclusion in Mexico. Origin: In 2013, the increase in insecurity and violence in Malinalco began to worry us. From this several inhabitants of the town began to come together to generate a process of reflection and diagnosis, where we identified a problem of inequality and lack of social cohesion in the community. We realized that the most affected population is the youth of San Martín, the most impoverished neighborhood in the municipality. And so it was that among the neighbors that we were interested in the problem, we formed the Imaginalco committee, and we decided to focus on prevention work with these young people. This gave rise to what today has become a comprehensive model of violence prevention in the municipality. The tireless search and struggle for the construction of a more just, united, peaceful Malinalco with opportunities for all has forced us to evolve and that is why we have decided to focus fundamentally on promoting the comprehensive development of children and young people with the that we work"

Germany, as the locomotive of the sector with almost 50 years of history in Doner production, produces approximately 500 tons per day. In the case of Spain, it began to be known in 2000, but unfortunately as a low quality product. The low qualification of the workforce and the low involvement of the producers were the reasons for this bad image.

We aim to quickly understand your circumstances and children's requirements along with what assets you have and who should receive your assets on death. From there will advise you on the correct estate plan for your circumstances and wishes and draft your Will and any associated documents accordingly. Many firms attempt to do this over the phone and then decide if it is worth sending a consultant out to see you. Whilst this approach is understandable, certainly from a commercial aspect, it doesn't resonate with our principles and culture. It is not often you will sit down and make arrangements for your Will, the financial security of your family, who should receive your assets and under what terms. With this in mind we take the time to come out and see each and every one of our clients, explaining how a Will works on death and how to ensure, as best as possible, that your assets can be distributed at death in accordance with your wishes and that your family have the financial security that you desire for them. Put simply, to complete this process properly and to do you any justice, this process needs to be carried out face to face. Anything less will, without doubt, leave shortfalls that can prevent your wishes being upheld on death. If you don't have a Will that meets your requirements or, if you have concerns that your current Will and overall estate plan is less than 100% suited to your needs, then Pattison James Associates will be able to resolve your situation to a point that once your new Will and estate plan has been signed you can sit back with the peace of mind you crave, knowing your Will and estate plan are exactly as you wish."

Lipids are a class of compounds that has been largely under-exploited, whereas it plays a key role in many medical conditions. GAOMA has the ambition to tap into the therapeutic potential of lipids. The company’s first drug candidate, GAO-3-02, is a novel patented active ingredient. It aims to address epilepsy and cognitive disorders, by targeting neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. In various preclinical experiments, GAO-3-02 has thus demonstrated its ability to limit seizures, protect and restore cognitive functions, on the long term, and with a good tolerance. With 50 to 70 million people affected in the world, epilepsy is one of the most common severe neurological conditions. The disease triggers seizures in patients, a phenomenon well known to the general public, but also various other disorders, such as cognitive impairment. Existing anti-epileptic drugs have relatively similar mechanisms of action, with the direct objective to disable neuronal activity. These drugs unfortunately leave a high unmet medical need: they are symptomatic treatments addressing seizures only, with a limited efficacy (one third of patients is drug resistant), and with poor tolerance (side effects among a majority of patients)."
