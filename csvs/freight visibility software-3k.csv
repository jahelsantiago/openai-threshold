When I first started out in 2014 working on-the-grounds in the warehouse of my Online Retail company AlphabetDeal, I realized through my first-hand experiences managing multiple accounts, communicating with product development and production teams, and working alongside my employees that I needed to maximize efficiency. Instead of manually organizing multiple spreadsheets and analyzing data from several software systems, I wanted something that would help me have a better understanding of the inner workings of my company so I could solve problems with product grouping and distribution before they happened. Since my personal mission is to help my customers Share, Save, and Give Back, my solution to this management issue was to develop Global Business Commerce, which turned hard work and inspiration into a single, easy to use, system. I now use GBC to serve customers all over the world and have had many positive experiences. For this reason, I want to embody my philosophy of Share, Save, and Give Back by encouraging other business owners to use Global Business Commerce so they can improve their organizations. It is my hope that they will have the same positive experience as I have had with GBC. Sincerely, Amar Chavda, Founder of Global Business Commerce"

Existing E-band front-ends are bulky (~size of shoe-box), expensive (~$11k) and power hungry – and are not suited for small cell and massive MIMO. Multifractal is addressing this problem by developing fully integrated E-band front-ends on a single chip, in silicon (CMOS / BiCMOS). Our front-end chips will make E-band front-ends so small (size of a match-box), and so cheap (~$20), that they will cover every lamp-post and every street corner! Multifractal's enabling technology is the ability to create high-Q E-band filters (and diplexers) on-chip in silicon and integrate them directly (still on chip) with the LNA, PA, switches and mixers, all in cheap mass producible silicon. Our customers can then feed the output of our IC directly into the digital back-end, reducing their front-end design, size, cost and effort. They do not have to worry about the RF – we do all that for them! This will enable miniaturization of the entire E-band front-end, for the first time allowing small cell and massive MIMO."

1824164,"0.2564248870537008","Tevva is pioneering zero-emission transport with revolutionary battery-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell range extender technology. Tevva trucks optimise range, driver experience, and total ownership cost while significantly reducing the environmental impact from the urban freight and logistics sectors. Tevva trucks are as cost-effective and operationally flexible as diesel trucks. A Tevva truck has at least 1,000 fewer moving parts than a traditional diesel truck, lowering maintenance costs and increasing uptime. Combining realistic capital costs and reduced operating costs means that Tevva trucks achieve total cost of ownership (TCO) parity with an equivalent Euro 6 diesel truck. The capability to deploy on long routes every day means that Tevva trucks replace their traditional diesel counterparts. As a fully zero-emission truck with minimal moving parts, Tevva offers a step-change in fleet longevity and a radical reduction in lifetime cost per kilometre. Tevva trucks are smooth, responsive, and relaxing to drive. They are much quieter than traditional diesel trucks, allowing for greater flexibility where night-time deliveries in urban residential areas are concerned. The trucks simultaneously address the dual crises of climate change and urban air quality because they offer the lowest possible CO2 per km and eliminate 100% of tailpipe pollution (NOx, SOx, and particulates). Having Tevva BEVs and REX BEVs in your fleet makes environmental sense and, with long-term savings on maintenance and running costs, is a great business decision. Tevva is an expert in technology because it matters and makes a positive difference to humanity. Tevva trucks are already on the road and have accrued hundreds of thousands of miles in customers' hands. All Tevva trucks are available in left and right-hand drive and subject to European Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWTA). Join us as we power the zero-emission revolution."

You see, we understand that too much change at one time, often results in a slower realisation of the intended benefits. And in some instances, an inability to realise the benefit at all.

When formulating the appropriate solution, we recognise that no two businesses are the same and therefore we leverage a range of different technologies, from several reputable vendors, to design a fit for purpose solution for every engagement.

So, we have removed the adjustable height function to eliminate this risk to end-users. We utilise an insert for a minor adjustment. Our jack stands have been designed to meet the requirements of Australian Standard AS/NZS 2538:2016. They have been independently tested and certified by the University of Newcastle, NSW and the University of Southern Queensland, Australia to provide you with the highest level of confidence."

He uses the 12-hectare site of this art institution as a field to “harvest” Liquid Files, from the pond and fields to the greenhouses, outbuildings, kitchen and laboratory. From 29 May the first results can be seen in the form of an installation. This installation will then evolve over five months, following the seasons. As a sculptor, Egied Simons wants to be able to work with any material, even the most fragile and perishable; as a photographer he wants to paint with light, with the material itself, without the intervention of film or digitisation. He searches for structures, stratification, openness and densification and constructs landscape atmospheres. Using special techniques, he records biological material consisting of fungi, cobwebs, pollen, trapped organisms and other forms or residues of life as Liquid Files. In a projected form, structures and processes are greatly enlarged and come to life in real time with infinite sharpness. The projectors with their heat and light act as an activator; organisms and processes are given the space for movement and develop over time within the given spatial structure. The Liquid Files are projected as triptychs within an installation that has the shape of a theater, where the three projection fields are marked with seating elements. This installation, built with robust materials found on the site of the Verbeke Foundation, provides a spatial framework for the Liquid Files. The research into Liquid Files will enter its second phase from June, a phase of further deepening, further research and new forms of presentation. In addition, Egied Simons will realize a number of other spatial works on the site of the Verbeke Foundation (including the “Solid Files”)."

Since the upcoming building assignment in the Netherlands will lead to densification of the existing environment, we are developing projects with a strong focus on the neighbourhood. In project development, economic principles usually come first, followed by the interests of users and other stakeholders. Finally, attention may also be paid to the appearance of the building. The impact on the environment is usually of secondary importance. DubbeLL emphatically does things differently, because we consider the contribution of a new project to the liveability and liveliness of the neighborhood to be the most important. We therefore take the added value for the neighborhood as the starting point for our real estate developments. Because every neighborhood has a unique character, we analyze the qualities present and required in the area at the start of a project. We work on projects where users, owners and local residents can meet and be proud of. Through a Neighborhood App, all those involved are brought into contact with each other and with DubbeLL to inform them about the project, but also to programmatically or conceptually strengthen the development.

Our technology is designed to be financially profitable, technically feasible, and good for investors, the environment and the community at large. Our BOSS technology provides a scalable, automated, water-based solution that is colour agnostic, separating black plastic to the same 98% purity as other colours. BOSS is a technology that separates the ‘hard to recycle’ stream of mixed rigid waste plastics by amplifying slight differences in relative densities between polymers through the manipulation of fluid dynamic principles of water. Our patented system uses oscillation to generate specific flow patterns in the water, which affect different polymer types in different ways. This novel process technology effectively stratifies different polymers based on density, allowing us to split particles with a density delta of 0.005 gcm-3. Our primary goal has been achieved with the establishment of our flagship plant in Newcastle in Q2 2018. The plant is fully operational with an annual capacity of 6000 tons; recycling mixed rigid waste plastic feedstock and dispatching sales of our recycled PE & PP post-consumer resin to our customers in the UK and EU.

As a new breed of business coaches we don’t just guide from the sideline, but get in the game with you. We help businesses identify their strategy for growth and implement it from within. The bad news is that most businesses fail. Usually quickly, sometimes spectacularly and often after decades of work. They don’t always go bankrupt either — they just never deliver the lifestyle or rewards they promised. That exciting adventure slowly becomes a stressful burden. Now the good news: we’re here to help. Not to be another voice telling you what you should do, but to get in and help you do it. Not to just give recommendations, but to drive results. So let’s get started. FUTURE FOCUSED PARTNERSHIP Building a sustainable business of real value requires a long-term hands on approach. We roll up our sleeves and get involved in your business.

So don’t worry, we’ll never claim to know it all — but we definitely know someone who does. ACCOUNTABILITY ALL ROUND There’s a big difference between planning to do something and actually doing it.

We can finally announce that Secret City Trails has been acquired by the team behind Netherlands-based CityGoose. When we founded Secret City Trails in 2017, we set out on our journey of reinventing how people discover and enjoy cities. Since then, we had the great joy of bringing 100s of playful discovery experiences to more than 60 European cities. We were supported by, and learned a lot from, our incredible investors, Speedinvest, Techstars and Transavia Ventures BV. With our small, yet dedicated team, we made 10,000s of curious customers very happy! However, after these past few (challenging) years, we, as founders, reflected on what's next for our business, and for us personally. We made the (hard) decision to focus our energy elsewhere and find a new team to keep growing the Secret City Trails brand and platform. The new team are Frans and Lidwine, who will take over as of May 2022. As for us, we want to end with a note of gratitude. We are grateful to our customers — our business would not exist without you! To our creators — there would be no experiences to sell without your creations! To our investors — we could not have grown as much as we did if it wasn’t for your support. To all of our team, past and present — the ride would not have been the same without your enthusiasm and commitment. THANK YOU! We leave you with the wise words of T.S Eliot, ""What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.""

From then until now, we’ve been helping public and cultural institutions break down barriers and engage more people than ever before. We know that sometimes abstract ideas, like the renaissance, impressionism, or extremism, can be difficult to understand, making people feel excluded from the conversation. This is particularly true for museums, art galleries, universities, and government departments, who risk alienating new audiences. By producing audiovisual content, including animations, podcasts, and live projections, we’ve found our team of talented project directors, animators, illustrators, engineers, artists and composers, is able to open a window into the world of abstract ideas, helping people of all backgrounds explore and understand new concepts. We work with our clients to communicate ideas in a way that is both accessible and engaging, attracting a more inclusive and diverse audience. So if you’re interested in joining organisations like the Tate, School of Life, and Met Police, to broaden and inspire your following, we’d love to hear from you."

Our Story… Through the last century the human race has endured many viruses and pathogens; while some were eradicated over time, many became part of our lives as did the ensuing health problems and diseases. The year 2020 was a wake-up call for the entire planet. We saw, in rather an extreme manner, how susceptible we are and how comprised our immune system is due to the contaminants, additives, harmful chemicals, and toxins that we consume and use daily. Over the last thirty years, I have personally experienced the ill-effects of it all. I believe that contamination is all pervasive and is doing us grave harm, leaving us vulnerable to many diseases and allergies. Where lies the solution then? Our body is like a car, the more shabbily we treat it, the sooner it will cease to run. In the same way, the more toxins we put in our body the easier it is for the viruses and pathogens to attack and break us. Today, we have healthier alternatives to everything. So, why don’t we, for a start toss out the harmful and toxic products? I know it is easier said than done because these alternates are not readily available, not all at one place, at least. Since the pace of our lives is so hectic we tend to take the easier route and compromise our health in the bargain. Over the years I have sourced natural and toxin-free food and personal care products for my family and me, it hasn’t been easy. I have had to spend a lot of time studying each product to verify its authenticity. The products we needed were never available at one place which only made it more time consuming and exhausting. LIVVSafe.com is an endeavour to help us to live a better, healthier and wholesome life by providing as many healthy and safe products as we can, all at one place. Our Journey so far …..

Also called Release Mounts, KSM fiberglass fish reproductions provide sportsmen with the highest quality and value and symbolize an age of environmental awareness. Our skilled artists capture the rich beauty and realism of nature and, under the direction of Marine Artist Raymond Douglas, transform raw materials into the ultimate representation of an angler’s most notable achievement. Inspired by Accomplished Artists, King Sailfish Mounts of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, was started in 1991 by an enthusiastic Raymond Douglas. The concept was to introduce a new method for the mounting of gamefish due to the growing demand of the catch and release sportfishing community. Formerly a Financial Accountant, Douglas began his new career at home in his garage, where he began to experiment and refine his own skills for specimen gathering, molding, casting, and airbrushing various species of local gamefish. After a successful debut at the Miami International Boat Show, KSM became a runaway commercial success. Douglas immediately moved out of the family garage and acquired key personnel from the once well-known Pflueger Marine Taxidermy and J. T. Reese Taxidermy Studios. Within a short time, KSM had developed a growing clientele and soon would serve customers from all parts of the world. In 2022, Daniel Miers joined the team as CEO, bringing with him a wealth of experience in the marine industry and a deep commitment to environmental sustainability. With his leadership, King Sailfish Mounts continues to be a world-class producer of fish mounts and a leader in marine conservation. While KSM continues to produce mounts traditionally by hand, one-at-a-time, Miers has also introduced new technologies and materials to improve the quality and efficiency of production. Under his guidance, KSM has expanded and is now the world's number one B2C marine art & taxidermy company."

We seek to build a cultural sector that has the skills and resources to promote the shared history housed within their collections. We were inspired by conversations with museum curators during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of losses in funding, staffing shortages, and general capacity issues, no one gave up. The passion for preserving and promoting unique histories shone through even during the hardest times. From those conversations, Forager Education was born. Our founder, Bryce Mathew Watts, an anthropologist and ethnobotanist, wanted to find a way to get involved in the recovery through collaboration and industry development opportunities. Partnering first with the BC Museums Association, Forager Education began work on developing The VR Voyage Classroom as an outlet for educational programming that museums across British Columbia were developing. Through the support of the Association and Futurpreneur Canada, Forager Education embarked on a year-long research and development journey to create The VR Voyage Classroom and the curriculum services offered to our partners. Now with The VR Voyage Classroom live and our team of educators in place, we are launching our next phase of programming. Working with a significant number of British Columbia’s cultural institutions, we are bringing together curriculum development programs with audience generation and monetization opportunities to build a stronger cultural sector through collaboration, funding connection, and digital support services. This unique business model was one of the reasons that Forager Education and founder Bryce Mathew Watts were selected as official Canadian delegates to the G20 YEA Summit in Milan, Italy in 2021."

Today, using hydrogen for decarbonization depends on rare, expensive precious metals used as catalysts for producing clean hydrogen and converting it to clean power. H2U electrocatalyst discovery is an unprecedented, proprietary, end-to-end ultrahigh throughput AI and data-driven process focused on discovery of new catalysts for generation of clean hydrogen and fuel cell power production. The process prepares, characterizes, and quantifies the catalytic activity of millions of compositions per month and then closes the loop with big data analysis and AI to refine/guide the search. H2U Technologies is also developing a novel and disruptive PEM Electrolyzer design, made to drive rapid and large scale adoption of grid scale electrolysis. Our company is co-founded by Motus Ventures and H2U Chief Science Advisor, Dr Nathan Lewis, the George L. Argyros Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. Nate was the founding Director and Scientific Director of JCAP - the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, at Caltech, where he was the Principal Investigator on the winning $122M award from DOE for research and study of groundbreaking catalysts for clean hydrogen generation. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/h2u-technologies-closes-11m-in-series-a-funding-from-jericho-energy-ventures-freeflow-ventures-volo-earth-ventures-and-hess-corporation-301493523.html?tc=eml_cleartime"

We can’t address climate change just by building new net-zero homes. We need solutions that make the homes we live in right now net-zero to preserve a liveable climate. Deep Energy Retrofits are the solution. Around the world, retrofit initiatives are improving how we design and install deep energy retrofits. But those innovations are hidden behind patents and copyrights that prevent good ideas from spreading beyond the boundary of one company or project. Retrofit Canada is an open-source, deep energy retrofit non-profit. We have partnered with Butterwick Construction on Deep Energy Retrofit demonstration projects in Edmonton, Alberta. We want to start a movement to make existing homes net-zero. WHAT IS A DEEP ENERGY RETROFIT? Deep Energy Retrofits use cutting-edge imaging technology to design prefabricated panels that are attached on the exterior of the roof and walls of buildings. These air-tight, super-insulated panels are built off-site. They are fully finished with insulation, windows, and siding and take just weeks to install with minimal disruption to residents. A Deep Energy Retrofit can make a building 70 per cent more efficient and reduce CO2 emissions by 400 tonnes a year. When combined with renewable energy and energy-efficient technology, like solar and heat pumps, this technology can make a home net-zero."

The first night she used it, Oli (and all of us) finally slept through the night! Thus, the Snuggy Buddy Wearable Lovey Blanket was born! Snuggy Buddy is a social good company, supporting something that is near and dear to us. We proudly donate a percentage from each sale to buy fabric for Project Linus, an organization that makes blankets for babies and children in need. We are committed to not only helping Snuggy Buddy Babies sleep safely and soundly, but helping babies everywhere, get the chance they deserve, to Sleep Sound + Dream Big!"

In most cases, quizzes, tests, polls will outperform more basic formats like blogs, videos, and case studies for a number of reasons. Quest content is more interactive than traditional content which provides an advantage in algorithm-based feeds. It can entertain or educate your audience while holding their attention longer, and it immediately positions your business as an expert authority in your field. More than just content creation. Our innovative approach to developing content starts with a goal-oriented business development plan and clear KPIs. Your Quest content is synchronized with analytics reporting, automation sequences, and market segmentation software to form a complete closed-loop marketing campaign that drives the success of your business."

Or seeking a specific benefit like improved focus or memory retention. You might need a general knowledge of which natural remedy is right for you. Whatever the supplement is, only one thing matters: the truth. You need to know: Does it work? What are the effects? You may have looked at reviews on various websites, but found they often feel like hyped sales pieces. A lot of them smell suspiciously of affiliation to particular brands. You need a source of reviews that is safe from bias. A source that values the truth above profit at all times. In 2012 we were in a similar predicament.

We are 3rd (and 4th) generation farmers. We work with several types of lime. Our lime has always been used for farming. When more and more people inquired into purchasing lime for their yards, we decided we needed a better way to deliver it. Around the same time, the internet provided studies suggesting lime was used as a pest repellent in gardens, as well as a sanitizing agent in animal housing. We know that some lime (hydrated lime, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide) can burn skin, and some lime (dolomitic, straight out of the quarry) isn’t very strong. We knew we needed an answer to this. We came up with a formulated version of hydrated lime, which is just as strong but safer. It lacks the caustic nature of hydrated lime, while also containing virtually no silica as in dolomitic lime. We purchased 1000 bags and slapped a label on them and proceeded to sell out quicker than we ever expected. Then we knew if we wanted to take the jump into retail, we would need to go in with both feet. With the passing of our father, we knew if we didn’t do it now, it probably wouldn’t happen. So… here we are. Excited. Overwhelmed with positive responses. Surrounded by enthusiastic people who share common goals. We wake up excited for each and every day that brings new challenges, fun challenges and rewarding challenges. So, why a frog you ask?… Frogs eat insects. They are inherently a natural pest controller. It also helps that they are “lime” green. And as coincidence would have it, a little frog would come visit us every day while we were toiling in the barn. He is our mascot. His name is Ricardo. And “First Saturday?”… We choose the sieve size to make the product last at least one month. Therefore, you apply the product once a month, or on the “First Saturday” of the month."

The theme of #1000Hires is summed up in this story. Once upon a time, there was an old man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach every morning before he began his work. Early one morning, he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and found the vast beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see, stretching in both directions. Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching. As the boy walked, he paused every so often and as he grew closer, the man could see that he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea. The boy came closer still and the man called out, “Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?” The young boy paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can’t return to the sea by themselves,” the youth replied. “When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.” The old man replied, “But there must be tens of thousands of starfish on this beach. I’m afraid you won’t really be able to make much of a difference.” The boy bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it as far as he could into the ocean. Then he turned, smiled, and said, “It made a difference to that one!” adapted from The Star Thrower, by Loren Eiseley (1907 – 1977)"

Even though we are from a whole different region of the country, he had friends in the industry and became fascinated by the product and challenges it conveyed. Consequently, our entire family followed him to support his new venture. We grew up living in the farm, where we got to witness and learn every detail of the business. As little kids, we helped out as much as we could during high seasons like Valentine’s or Mother’s day. We traveled to international trade shows, met colleagues, clients; suppliers all whom we consider family and have seen us grow up over the years. Eventually, we parted to finish our studies abroad and started following our own passion, until we decided it was time come back to our roots. Returning to Ecuador to keep learning about the family business. We started to realize our friends abroad didn’t know where their flowers were coming from. Their shopping for flowers was limited to what they found in the supermarket, and designer flowers were not affordable for everyone. We wanted to knock down the door of the traditional way to shop for flowers and open up direct access to premium and fresh cut flowers! That’s when we decided to use what we have learned over the years about the industry and our different talents to create a unique flower experience. Changing the traditional way of shopping for flowers, unearthing an unknown world of roses. Sharing a little piece of our world from our farm to your door. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!

The site content includes over 4,000 quizzes, each one written by teachers. These complement the National Curriculum and are designed to help children with particular topics. In addition to the core subjects of English, Science and Maths, we also cover Geography, History, Design and Technology, Art, RE, Citizenship, PSHE and more in depth - in fact, we cover the whole of the National Curriculum for all subjects except for foreign languages. Collectively, the quizzes enable comprehensive learning and revision for all school children aged 5 to 17. Parents across the world make use of Education Quizzes and we have sites in the USA and India which follow the equivalent curriculum. On payment of a monthly or yearly subscription, children can access all the quizzes on the entire site. We also have free sections on topics such as nature, literature, flags of the world, World War I and much, much more – a boon when you’ve had enough of revising! Each time that a quiz is played, the system creates a record showing the date played/score achieved which is overwritten each time a quiz is re-played. The recording method provides motivation for the children and an easy way for parents to monitor progress. And it’s not just parents who find us useful – schools can have access to the whole site for all their pupils and teachers for just £95 per year. That’s amazing value and equates to less than 10 pence per pupil per year! Teachers and private tutors can also make use of our Teacher Assistant which enables them to set self-marking homework for an entire class – what’s more, this feature is entirely free of charge!

From then on, his wife Marie-Anne joined him in the adventure and a small team was created and set up in the center of Boersch (67), a few kilometers from Obernai. In the 70's, the company quickly extended its electrical activity to household appliances and heating. In the permanent search for innovative and reliable solutions, Gérard Lehmann surrounds himself with competent and expert people, such as a heating engineer for the heating part. This master electrician, entrepreneur at heart, seized the opportunities offered to him and surfed on the wave of oil heating and the first automatic oil stoves. A Franco-Austrian partnership was born immediately with a historical supplier: Haas+Sohn. Gérard Lehmann naturally withdrew from the company he had founded and handed it over to his children. Today, Thierry Lehmann, Gérard's eldest son, is the CEO, assisted by his two brothers: Grégoire and Joseph. The family SME has thus gone through the times by expanding its teams to reach today about twenty employees. In order to survive and ensure its durability, this small structure is constantly seeking to offer its customers reliable and innovative products. It is by this way that Est-Ménager has launched, since the beginning of the years 2000, in the renewable energies with the distribution of stoves and biomass boilers."

The demand for vision services is expected to flood the healthcare system by 2020 due to age related eye disease and the diabetes epidemic.

Bedwetting afflicts approximately 15 percent of children between 4 and 15 years old, which causes stress in many families. Older children can feel socially inhibited and choose to avoid activities such as camps or sleepovers. To address these problems, Pjama AB has developed a new type of pyjamas that offers relief in case of bedwetting.  Pjama is a Swedish invention by Pjama AB and a business innovation team at Smart Textiles. It is based on a superabsorbent textile in combination with a waterproof and breathable membrane. The product has successfully been tested by children for more than 18 months and it is already recommended by Urologists. Since Pjama pants are machine washable, they cause less strain on the environment than disposable products such as diapers. They also save a lot of washing since the bed sheets stay dry all night.  Since Pjama look and feel exactly like normal pyjama pants, they are more comfortable than diapers, which older children tend to dislike. With Pjama, children can easily and discreetly change pyjama pants when needed and they don’t have to feel different from their siblings or friends."

We design and build dramatic venues entirely ourselves, creating not just beautiful venues, but ones imbued with a sense of meaning that we seek to inject into even the tiniest details. We believe the old ways of doing this are coming to and end, and we aim to be first to show you why. In 2021 we opened our first bar, Somerset. Built with materials from around the world collected over more than 5 years of boots-on-the-ground travel, now set in a sprawling, vibrant garden and conservatory in the heart of Over-the-Rhine. In 2022 we opened Somerhaus, a sister private event space to meet the intense demand Somerset sees for private events (Somerset is a bar and a community gathering spot. We built it for everybody, so it's open every day). Later in 2022 we opened Alice, a nightlife spot featuring an entirely projection mapped dance floor with mind bending visuals. Inspired by the early early days of Northern Soul then Acid House in the UK, followed by too many hazy weekends in Berlin. Most recently we opened Second Story, a cocktail bar and patio in Covington that embraces many of the fierce independent art and literary movements that have inspired us. Next up we have one more bar to open in Cincinnati in 2023- and trust us, we are really going for it with this one. Then we move onto our true goal, to build a series of design hotels for the next generation. We've spent two years learning, shaping our culture, sharpening our skills, and building our processes.

There are so many incredible, hard-working organizations that stretch every penny and every volunteer hour they can get to support our thriving city. That’s why we came together to form 100 Men Who Care Vancouver: an exclusive charitable society of diverse high achievers, executive-thinkers and innovators. All of whom want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, so they can give and do more, while making a massive community impact. Through our quarterly events held at premiere locations around Vancouver, we encourage our members to become more aware of the countless ways of giving back to our community. We know that everyone gives back in their own way – some of us have time, others skills. Our members are able to give back financially. Here’s How It Works: When you become a member of 100 Men Who Care Vancouver all that is required from you is an hour of your time (to collectively vote on a charity) and a small $100 donation per quarter (4 times a year). That’s all it takes! Now add 99 other men (guys, dudes, bros, gentlemen, whatever you prefer) just like you and you’re making an immediate positive effect on the lives of our neighbors, by giving up to $40,000 each year to worthy causes (you vote for) right here in beautiful Vancouver, BC. Why Attend An Event? Not only will attending an event will make you aware of the countless ways of giving back to our community, but they are a lot of fun. Each quarterly event is different from the last and can range from Whiskey tasting to Golf Tournaments. The focus of our events is philanthropy, but afterward, there are opportunities for networking with Vancouver’s most influential and caring men who want to grow both business relationships and friendships."

Having spent the beginning of the decade living in Melbourne, they’d enjoyed many hot summer nights eating plates of Korean fried chicken, served with ice cold beers in the city’s bustling Chinatown district. Nights for friends soon became pop-ups in pubs and after a series of successful residencies Coqfighter found its first permanent home with Boxpark. A short DIY build later and Coqfighter was open to the public with queues to boot. In a few short years Coqfighter has grown to three restaurant locations and a series of delivery kitchens.

6474670,"0.3450177475757148","The Defeat-NCD Partnership was established in January 2018 to help tackle the most significant global health problem of the age: premature death, sickness, disability, and the associated social and economic impacts of selected non-communicable diseases. The initial focus is on diabetes and hypertension with expansion to other NCDs in due course probably starting with the early detection and treatment of cervical and breast cancer. The Partnership recognises that NCDs are now the major contributor to the global burden of disease. Diabetes and hypertension along with the other non-communicable diseases cause cumulative economic losses in low- and middle-income countries estimated at US$ 7 trillion for 2011-2025. This sum far outweighs the estimated annual US$ 11.4 billion cost of interventions to reduce the burden. Meanwhile, less than 2% of global development assistance for health goes to NCDs of which only a miniscule share is for diabetes and hypertension. Resource poor countries are constrained by several factors in their response to NCDs. To start with, poorer people are more vulnerable because they are more likely to have to endure unhealthy living and working conditions. They are less able to afford the healthier lifestyle options. They are also often less educated on the risks without having the knowledge to manage them. These countries can have weak institutional capacities and invest less in prevention, public health protection, and curative care. Furthermore, prevalent inequalities mean that the poorest groups can least afford the remedies on offer that include a lifetime of medication. Special attention is also needed for the hundreds of millions of people suffering humanitarian concerns. These are the people seriously affected or displaced by disasters and conflicts. Their life chances if they suffer from NCDs are known to be severely compromised by the discontinuities in provision that happen in crisis contexts."

5518658,"0.3481322111925781","His personal search for better health led Sergey to start his own company with the goal of helping others achieve a pain-free life. As a former athlete, Sergey found himself waking up every day in a great deal of pain. He would have shooting pain in his left shoulder and a lower back that was constantly aching. Sergey could not turn his head very well either, but thought it was just a normal part of aging. His arms sometimes fell asleep, so too did his legs if he sat down for too long. In addition to all of these issues, Sergey suffered a separated shoulder when his old boss at a Thai massage studio tried to perform a new technique on him while he was a student. As you can see, Sergey and pain were well acquainted. That all began to change when Sergey was in the latter stages of his massage therapy program at Makami College. Sergey had already decided to focus on the therapeutic and rehabilitative aspects of massage therapy, so he was excited when renowned Orthopedic Massage Therapist James Waslaski was set to give a seminar on the discipline. Still suffering from his separated shoulder, Sergey tried to have Mr. Waslaski look at it right away. Instead, the world-renowned therapist preached patience and assured Sergey his shoulder would be perfectly fine by the end of the seminar. Initially Sergey was quite skeptical of Mr. Waslaski’s statement, but after a minute or so his skepticism dissipated. When Mr. Waslaski later asked for someone who was suffering from shoulder pain to act as a volunteer, Sergey nearly leapt out of his chair and was on stage within a matter of seconds. About an hour after receiving the treatment from Mr. Waslaski, Sergey was pain-free. That experience motivated Sergey to help other people to get rid off their pain."

To this day, Cheech & Chong films remain the number one weekend video rentals, and Cheech is widely acknowledged as a cultural icon. He is an actor, director, writer, musician, art collector, and humanitarian, a man who has enough talent, humor, and intelligence to do just about anything. Today, he is also recognized as a preeminent Chicano art advocate. In the mid-1980s, Cheech began developing what is now arguably the finest private collection of Chicano art. Furthering his goal to introduce Chicano art to a wider audience, he entered into the partnership with the City of Riverside and Riverside Art Museum. Opening in 2020, The Cheech will explore Chicano culture from the barrio to the bay, cholos to Cesar Chavez, and pre-Columbian to modern murals. As Cheech says, it will be the “international center of Chicano art, not for only paintings, but sculpture, photography, and video arts.” The Riverside Art Museum will oversee the administration and programming of The Cheech. Opportunities include naming rights at The Cheech, recognition on the Founders Wall, sponsorships, membership in the Founding Corporate Council, VIP opportunities, and employee enrichment.
