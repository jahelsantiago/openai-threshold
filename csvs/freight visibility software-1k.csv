After almost 18 years of practicing in San Francisco, she was fed up with bureaucratic red tape, surprise legislation affecting her clients, and unnecessary wasted time. In her dedication to do her part to solve the housing crisis, she encountered needless obstacles. It took 2 years to get just one accessory dwelling unit (ADU) project approved inside an existing building. For her that was the last straw. She fought for change and those same projects can be approved now in just 4 months. Going through that process made her realize a systemic change to the way we all make buildings was needed. In order to provide the highest quality service to our clients we all need: a larger network a conduit to stay informed about all upcoming legislation that impacts our clients an advocacy group to help steer legislation int he right direction for our clients better access to information and to pool our resources. Placemakers PRO was born. Our businesses can thrive if we grow our referral network, connect with new consultants, and partner to affect change. We can save our clients time and money by sharing resources like surveys and reports openly. We can bring significant value to our clients if we work together to impact new policies, codes, and legislation BEFORE they are enacted. If our industry is going to tackle solving the housing crisis and build 3.5M new units in the state of California, we have to figure out how to work faster. It’s time to break down our barriers and get to work together. That's why our vision for Property ATLAS is to create a new way of making buildings. Together. We can reinvent our industry by uniting architects, engineers, and contractors to create camaraderie, trust, and community."

The ELSO Registry is the basis for many publications involving circulatory support of newborns, children and adults. Following the examples of Euro-ELSO and ELSO Asia-Pacific, in 2012 Latin America created the local chapter of ELSO. The foundation of ELSO Latinoamericana was held in Santiago – Chile, during the Latin American ECMO Symposium in 2012. About 250 ECMO professionals from Latin America participated in the event, which also had the participation, via videoconference, of representatives of the ELSO (Dr. Steve Conrad, Dr. Michael Hines, Dr. Peter Rycus, and Dr. William Lynch). During that first meeting, Santiago was chosen as the headquarters of ELSO Latinoamericana. We believe that the founding of the ELSO chapter in Latin America was very important in increasing the use and credibility of ECMO in the region, through ELSO's standards, guidelines and experience. A common database and research group are other consistent factors implemented. Furthermore, a standard education process is now possible. Learn more at: http://elsolatam.net/elso-latino-americana/"
